TeamCore
============

This is a Minecraft mod team provider. It provides a extended team builder functionality, functioning as a framework. Mods can hook into this framework to provide objectives and score based events.
With this, you can easily create your own team based pvp matches or objective games, for example a galacticraft spacerace, a voltz destruction game or a simple team pvp match.

The Framework is completly configurable for your needs. You are welcome to leave me messages and ideas for extended features, that you would like to see in this mod.

Warning
=======
This mod is work in progress and nowhere near finished. This is a repository, that I use to develop this mod.
